Pacman group project written in c++ with OpenGL API with screen size scaling and smooth movement

Participants: Vidar stølsnes, Benjamin Loxley Wood & Kristian Røren Svanholm


The project should be launched from the main.cpp file and can easily be cloned into visual studios.

Missed goal: Texturing
As we worked on the last day we couldn't figure out textures so we elected to drop it.
We also know of a couple other groups who struggled with it the same way we did so we do not feel alone in that struggle.
In the assignment description the wording implies to us that texturing is not required to pass,
so if it is required we suggest you clarify the wording for the next years class :)
